First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

All required functionnalities are here.
Of course there are no communication with backend, I suppose the new broker must be saved in database when entered.
My biggest difficulty was my lack of knowledge in MUI.
I learned on the fly but as such I didn't spend much time trying to reproduce the whole page, in order to better focus on the required functionnalities.
It also lacks testing, which would be absolutely required in real conditions.
Thank you for your time.
